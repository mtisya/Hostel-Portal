1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the div. The elements within this div have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

  <div class="content">
    <p><img src="../erett.jpg" width="300" height="168" /> There are five hostels in the main campus with a total bed capacity of   800 students. The proximity of the hostels to the administration and   tuition area and security make the former the preferred place to stay.   The limited bed capacity provided by the hostels is supplemented by a   number of privately run hostels near the main campus.  A team coordinated from the department periodically assesses the quality   and standards of the hostels and advises students seeking accommodation   accordingly. Conversely the team advises the management of the private   hostels on the standards expected of their facilities.</p>

    <h2>Layout</h2>
    <p>Since this is a one-column layout, the .content is not floated. </p>
    <h3>Logo Replacement</h3>
    <p>An image placeholder was used in this layout in the .header where you'll likely want to place  a logo. It is recommended that you remove the placeholder and replace it with your own linked logo. </p>
    <p> Be aware that if you use the Property inspector to navigate to your logo image using the SRC field (instead of removing and replacing the placeholder), you should remove the inline background and display properties. These inline styles are only used to make the logo placeholder show up in browsers for demonstration purposes. </p>
    <p>To remove the inline styles, make sure your CSS Styles panel is set to Current. Select the image, and in the Properties pane of the CSS Styles panel, right click and delete the display and background properties. (Of course, you can always go directly into the code and delete the inline styles from the image or placeholder there.)</p>
